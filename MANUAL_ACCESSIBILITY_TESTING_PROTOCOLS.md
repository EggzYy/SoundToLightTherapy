# Manual Accessibility Testing Protocols

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive manual testing procedures for verifying accessibility features in the SoundToLightTherapy app. While automated tests cover functional aspects, manual testing is essential for validating user experience, VoiceOver functionality, and visual accessibility.

## Testing Environment Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **iOS Device**: iPhone or iPad running iOS 17+ for VoiceOver and haptic feedback testing
- **Mac Computer**: For Xcode simulator testing and development
- **External Monitor**: For color contrast and visual accessibility verification
- **Headphones**: For audio feedback testing

### Software Requirements
- **Xcode 15+**: For simulator testing and accessibility inspector
- **iOS 17+**: Target operating system
- **VoiceOver**: Built-in screen reader enabled
- **SwiftCrossUI**: Cross-platform compatibility testing

## VoiceOver Testing Procedures

### 1. VoiceOver Activation and Navigation
- Enable VoiceOver in Settings → Accessibility → VoiceOver
- Practice basic navigation gestures:
  - Single-finger swipe right/left to navigate elements
  - Double-tap to activate selected element
  - Two-finger swipe up/down for continuous reading

### 2. Element Accessibility Verification
- Navigate through all interactive elements:
  - Buttons should have clear labels and hints
  - Sliders should announce current values
  - Text fields should have appropriate keyboard types
  - Images should have descriptive alternative text

### 3. Screen Reader Compatibility Checklist
- [ ] All interactive elements are focusable
- [ ] Each element has meaningful accessibility labels
- [ ] Elements provide helpful accessibility hints
- [ ] Dynamic content changes are announced properly
- [ ] Custom gestures don't interfere with VoiceOver
- [ ] VoiceOver focus follows logical tab order

## Dynamic Type Testing Procedures

### 1. Font Size Scaling Verification
- Navigate to Settings → Display & Brightness → Text Size
- Test all available text size options:
  - Extra Small → Extra Extra Extra Large
  - Accessibility Medium → Accessibility Extra Extra Extra Large

### 2. Content Readability Assessment
- Verify text remains readable at all sizes
- Check for text truncation or overlapping
- Ensure layout adapts properly to larger text
- Confirm touch targets remain accessible

### 3. Extreme Size Testing
- Test with largest accessibility sizes
- Verify scroll views work properly
- Check for any layout breaks or visual issues

## Reduced Motion Testing Procedures

### 1. Motion Reduction Activation
- Enable Reduce Motion in Settings → Accessibility → Motion → Reduce Motion
- Restart the app to apply settings

### 2. Animation Behavior Verification
- Test all animated elements:
  - Transitions should be simplified or removed
  - Parallax effects should be disabled
  - Motion-based feedback should have alternatives
  - Focus changes should still be visually clear

### 3. Haptic Feedback Compatibility
- Verify haptic feedback respects reduced motion setting
- Check that essential feedback remains available
- Ensure no motion-triggered elements cause discomfort

## Color Contrast Testing Procedures

### 1. Visual Contrast Assessment
- Test all color combinations visually:
  - Text against background colors
  - Interface elements against backgrounds
  - Status indicators and alerts

### 2. WCAG 2.1 Compliance Verification
- **Normal Text**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- **Large Text**: Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- **Non-text Elements**: Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- **Enhanced Contrast**: 7:1 ratio for AAA compliance

### 3. Color Deficiency Simulation
- Use Xcode's Accessibility Inspector to simulate:
  - Deuteranopia (red-green deficiency)
  - Protanopia (red deficiency)
  - Tritanopia (blue-yellow deficiency)
- Verify all information is conveyed without color reliance

## Haptic Feedback Testing Procedures

### 1. Haptic Types Verification
- Test each haptic feedback type:
  - Success notifications
  - Warning notifications
  - Error notifications
  - Selection feedback
  - Impact feedback (light, medium, heavy)

### 2. Device-Specific Testing
- Test on different iPhone models:
  - iPhone 8 and earlier (basic haptics)
  - iPhone X and later (Taptic Engine)
  - iPad (varies by model)

### 3. Contextual Appropriateness
- Verify haptic feedback matches user actions
- Check that feedback isn't excessive or annoying
- Ensure critical feedback is distinct and noticeable

## Cross-Platform Testing Procedures

### 1. iOS-Specific Features
- Test features only available on iOS:
  - UIAccessibility APIs
  - iOS-specific haptic feedback
  - Platform-specific accessibility settings

### 2. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Verify functionality on non-iOS platforms:
  - Graceful degradation of iOS-specific features
  - Alternative implementations where needed
  - Consistent user experience across platforms

### 3. SwiftCrossUI Integration
- Test with SwiftCrossUI backend:
  - Verify accessibility traits work correctly
  - Check cross-platform color handling
  - Test reduced motion implementation

## Testing Schedule and Documentation

### Regular Testing Cadence
- **Weekly**: Basic accessibility smoke tests
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive accessibility audit
- **Per Release**: Full accessibility regression testing

### Test Documentation Template
```
Test Date: [Date]
Tester: [Name]
Device: [Device Model]
iOS Version: [Version]
Results: [Pass/Fail with notes]
Issues Found: [Description of any issues]
```

### Issue Severity Classification
- **Critical**: Prevents accessibility functionality
- **High**: Significant accessibility barrier
- **Medium**: Minor accessibility issue
- **Low**: Cosmetic or minor usability issue

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Accessibility Issues
- Immediately notify development team
- Document exact reproduction steps
- Prioritize fix in next release
- Consider temporary workarounds

### Regression Testing
- After any accessibility fix, perform:
  - Full VoiceOver retest
  - Dynamic Type verification
  - Color contrast check
  - Cross-platform validation
